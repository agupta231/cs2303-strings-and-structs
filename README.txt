# CS2303 - Project 3 Strings & Structs

This is the code base for my second project for CS2303.

Author: Ankur Gupta

## Summary

These two programs are different implementations and manipulations of C
strings/structs functions.

## Execution Instructions
### PA3A

Go into the `strings` folder (this step isn't required for the submission).
Then, type in `make` to compile the program. Afterwards, use `./ctest` to run
the program.

### PA3B

Go into the `structs` folder (this step isn't required for the submission).
Then, type in `make` to compile the program. Afterwards, use `./structtest` to 
run the program.

## Notes about the program
### PA3A

For every function that I implemented, it is prefixed with `my_`. Additionally,
for every function that I am supposed to duplicate, I run the same test with the
default functions to ensure that my function works exactly the same way.
